MATH NOIR
=========

She said her name was Min.  "I'm Max" I said. She was acute dame with nice
legs. What could she want with an out of shape square like me?  We were from
different circles. When she asked me to cosine for a loan, I suspected she must
have an angle. So, I gave her the third degree.  She continued to be obtuse,
even though it was clear that I was right. She noticed entry in the log on my
desk and took it for a sine that she should leave the area quick...
