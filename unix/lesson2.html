<h2>Files</h2>
<p>
A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file">file</a> on a modern
computer system is a named block of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information">information</a> accessible
to a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program">computer program</a>
and stored on some type of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-volatile_memory">non-volatile
memory</a>.
</p>
<p>
Files can contain both programs and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a>, and data files can store
text, images, sound, video, and many other kinds of data.  The two most common
types of data files for web designers are
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file">text files</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image">image files</a>. Web pages
are written in text files.
</p>


<h2>File systems and directories</h2>
<p>
Operating systems organize files through the use of a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system">file system</a>.  File
systems provide tools for the management of files and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_%28file_systems%29">
directories</a>.  A directory (or <i>folder</i>) is a special type of file that
can contain other files and directories within it.  Directories are used to
organize files to make them easier to find.
</p>
<p>
Since a directory can have directories inside it, and those directories can
directories inside them, and so on, we end up with a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure">tree structure</a> for
the file system.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/lesson2/webappdev_tree_view.png" alt="Tree view of webappdev">
</p>
<p>
The screenshot above shows the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_%28Unix%29">tree</a> program display
of a directory named <code>webappdev</code> that has four subdirectories named
<code>css</code>, <code>html</code>, <code>unix</code>, and <code>vim</code>.
Each of these subdirectories has two more subdirectories named
<code>examples</code> and <code>notes</code>.  The <code>notes</code> directory
under <code>unix</code> contains two files, <code>lesson1.txt</code> and
<code>lesson2.txt</code>. The <code>.txt</code>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filename_extension">filename
extention</a> suggests these are text files.
</p>
<p>
A directory that contains a file or directory is called the
<b>parent directory</b> of that file or subdirectory. In the example above,
the <code>notes</code> directory is the parent directory of the
<code>lesson1.txt</code> and <code>lesson2.txt</code> text files, and the
<code>webappdev</code> directory is the parent of the <code>css</code>,
<code>html</code>, <code>unix</code>, and <code>vim</code> subdirectories.
</p>


<h2>Paths</h2>
<p>
A modern computer system has hundreds of thousands of files and directories.
By utilizing the tree structure of the file system, it becomes possible to
organize and manage these hundreds of thousands of files. Each file is located
in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nesting_(computing)">nested</a>
series of directories.  The sequence of these nested directories ending with
the name of the file is called the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)">path</a> to that file.
</p>

<h3>Absolute Paths</h3>
<p>
At the top of the Unix file system is what is called the <b>root directory</b>,
which is always just <code>/</code> in Unix.  The <b>absolute path</b> to
any file in the filesystem is the sequence of directories, starting from the
root and ending with the file.
</p>
<p>
The easiest way to show how this works is by example.  The following diagram
shows part of a Unix filesystem tree.
</p>
<p>
<img src="images/lesson2/UnixDirectoryTree.png" alt="Unix directory tree">
</p>
<p>
The absolute path to the file <code>lesson1.txt</code> is:
</p>
<pre class="source" style="width: 480px;">
/home/jelkner/webappdev/unix/notes/lesson1.txt
</pre>


<h3>Relative Paths and the Current Working Directory</h3>
<p>
The absolute path to a file in the file system can be long, and it is normally
the case that the user is interested in files that are located in only one
small part of the system, located near the user.  By <q>near the user</q> we
mean near in the tree to the user's
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_working_directory">current
working directory</a>. You can think of the current working directory as your
present location as you move around the file system tree.
</p>
<p>
Again, it's much easier to show you than to tell you.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/lesson2/pwd_inside_webappdev.png" alt="Inside webappdev">
</p>
<p>
The screenshot above shows the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwd">pwd</a> program displaying the
current working directory as <code>/home/jelkner/webappdev</code>.  Next
it shows <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ls">ls</a> being run, with
the <code>css</code>, <code>html</code>, <code>unix</code>, and
<code>vim</code> directories as output.  Lastly, <code>tree</code> is run
again, this time with no
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_argument#Arguments">
argument</a>.
</p>
<p>
The relative path from the current working directory to the file
<code>lesson1.txt</code> is:
</p>
<pre class="source" style="width: 240px;">
unix/notes/lesson1.txt
</pre>
<p>
Notice that relative paths <b>do not</b> start with a slash (<code>/</code>).
</p>


<h3>Short Names for the Current and Parent Directories:
<code>.</code> and <code>..</code></h3>
<p>
In expressing relative paths we need a way to indicate both our current
working directory and its parent directory. Unix provides a very short way to
do this.  The current working directory is referred to with a single dot
(<code>.</code>) and the parent directory is referred to with two dots
(<code>..</code>). Note that since each file or directory can have only a
single parent, using <code>..</code> to refer to this parent directory is
unambiguous.
</p>


<h2>Our First Commands: <code>ls</code>, <code>pwd</code>, <code>cd</code>,
<code>mkdir</code>, and <code>rmdir</code></h2>
<p>
The follow unix commands are used to list the contents of the current working
directory, print the current working directory itself, move from one directory
to another, create a new directory, and remove an existing directory.
</p>
<div class="source">
<dl>
  <dt>ls</dt>
  <dd>List the contents of the current working directory.  <code>ls</code>
  has several useful <i>command line options</i> which start with a
  <code>-</code> (dash) character followed by one or more letters.
  <dl>
    <dt>ls -a</dt>
    <dd>Show hidden files and directories (files and directories whose names
    begin with <code>.</code> (dot).

    <dt>ls -l</dt>
    <dd>Show file details using a long format.</dd> 

    <dt>ls -t</dt>
    <dd>Sort listing by date, newest file first.</dd> 

    <dt>ls -S</dt>
    <dd>Sort listing by size, largest file first.</dd> 
  </dl>
  These options can be combined, so <code>ls -la</code>, <code>ls -lt</code>,
  <code>ls -lS</code>, and <code>ls -lat</code> are all useful forms.
  </dd>

  <dt>pwd</dt>
  <dd>Print working (current) directory.</dd>

  <dt>cd [<code>directory_name</code>]</dt>
  <dd>Change working directory to <code>directory_name</code>.</dd>

  <dt>mkdir [<code>directory_name</code>]</dt>
  <dd>Create directory <code>directory_name</code>.</dd>

  <dt>rmdir [<code>directory_name</code>]</dt>
  <dd>Remove <code>directory_name</code> if it is empty. If not empty, a
  warning will be returned and the directory will not be removed.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>
In the <code>webappdev</code> directory tree displayed above with the
<code>webappdev</code> directory located in the user's home directory
(<code>/home/[username]/</code>), typing the command:
<code>cd webappdev/unix</code> at the command prompt would change the current
working directory to <code>/home/[username]/webappdev/unix</code>.
</p>
<p>
Typing the <code>ls</code> command would then reveal the two subdirectories,
<code>examples</code>, and <code>notes</code>. Typing <code>pwd</code> will
display the full path to the current working directory:
</p>
<pre class="source" style="width: 320px;">
/home/[username]/webappdev/unix
</pre>
<p>
To move up one level in the directory tree, typing <code>cd ..</code> will
change the current working directory to <code>webappdev</code>. Typing
<code>ls</code> here will display the four subdirectories <code>css</code>,
<code>html</code>, <code>unix</code>, and <code>vim</code>.
</p>

<h2>Exercises:</h2>
<p>
The following exercises will give you practice with each of these new commands.
Note that the files that end in <code>.txt</code> in these exercises are text
files, not directories. Use the following command to create these files:
</p>
<pre>
    $ touch [file_name]
</pre>
<p>
We will learn a better way to create and edit text files in the next lesson.
