  Clear evidence of <i>time on task</i> is present through regular and timely
  commits. Attention to detail is evidenced by having validation links on
  all web pages for both HTML and CSS that give green bars validated. The
  design work show care and pride of authorship, and meets all technical
  requirements. Responsibility is demonstrated by fixing and closing any
  issues filed the previous week.
