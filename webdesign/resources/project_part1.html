<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Today we will start a project that will apply skills from all of our completed
lessons in the
<a href="http://www.openbookproject.net/tutorials/getdown/html">Getting Down
with HTML</a> tutorial. This will be your end of quarter project and will
use all the skills you have aquired this quarter. The goal is to have you
continue developing this project throughout the rest of the course, improving
it as your web development skills improve.
</p>

<h2>What Do I Need to Do?</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p>Choose a topic for your project.  The best projects are the ones you
  make for a customer - a club you are in, a sports league you play for,
  a project in our school, a small business a friend or family member is
  involved in, etc.
  </p><p>
  <i>Note:</i> The importance of choosing a good project, by which I mean one
  in which you have a strong personal interest and a customer with clear goals,
  can not be overemphasized. The goal is to have you iterate over this project
  for the rest of the year, improving it as your skills improve. So choose
  something that would be engaging and fun for you to work on!
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>Make a new <b>directory</b> inside your <code>website</code> directory
  for your project. The name you choose should relate to your project.</li>

  <li>Copy <code>min.html</code> to <code>[project]/index.html</code>.  This
  will be the start page for your project.</li>

  <li>Make a <b>link</b> from your home page to your project directory.</li>

  <li>Make a link from your project start page back to your home page.</li>

  <li>Make at least 5 pages about your project.</li>

  <li>Make links from your project start page to each of the pages of your
  project.</li>

  <li>To earn an A for the project, the following should be found on at least
  one of the 6 pages (the index page and the other 5 pages):
  <ul>
    <li>25 different HTML element types (spread over the whole project)</li>
    <li>unordered list</li>
    <li>ordered list</li>
    <li>definition list</li>
    <li>table</li>
    <li>4 or more images</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
If you followed each step correctly, you should see your new web pages by
clicking on your name
<a href="http://ict.gctaa.net/sections/itd110/students.html">here</a>
and following the link to your project start page.
