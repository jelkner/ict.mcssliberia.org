<h2>Course Description and Purpose:</h2>

An introduction to web page design using HTML 5 and CSS 3.  Students will learn
to create styled web pages using the latest web standards.
</p>
<p>

goal of enabling students to build their own websites.
</p>


<h2>Course Objectives:</h2>
<p>
The objective of this introductory web page design course is to help students 
quickly aquire the core skills needed to create syntactically correct, styled
web pages using the latest web standards. 
</p>
<p>
A detailed list of specific competencies (skills) for this course is included 
<a href="webdesign_comps.html">here</a>.
</p>


<h2>Tutorials and Resource Materials:</h2>
<p>
Our main resource material will be these two tutorials:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://openbookproject.net/tutorials/getdown/unix">Getting Down
with the Unix CLI</a>, by Jeffrey Elkner</li> 
<li><a href="http://openbookproject.net/tutorials/getdown/html">Getting Down
with HTML</a>, by Jeffrey Elkner and Jason Straw</li> 
<li><a href="http://openbookproject.net/tutorials/getdown/css">Getting Down
with CSS</a>, by Jeffrey Elkner</li> 
</ul>
<p>
Other supplementary matrials will be provided as needed.
</p>


<h2>Evaluation and Grading:</h2>
<p>
The central goal of this program is for students to aquire real world skills
in web application development.  In pursuit of that goal we will take a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competency-based_learning">competency
based learning</a> approach,  and evaluation will focus on each student's
ability to perform varifiable tasks (competencies) for each course in the
program through completion of hands-on projects using the skills.
</p>

<p>Students will be evaluated on their ability to perform each skill in the
competency list for each course (see the <b>Course Objectives</b> section
above) and given a numeric score using the following scale:</p> 

<table class="competencies">
<tr>
  <th>Score</th><th>Meaning</th>
<tr>
  <td>4</td><td>Expert - Can teach others the skill</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>3</td><td>Competent - Can perform the skill without assistance</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2</td><td>Practicing - Can perform the skill with help</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1</td><td>Exposed - Can recognize the skill being performed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>0</td><td>No Evidence of mastery or recognition of skill</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>A student is <i>competent</i> when she can perform the skill without
assistance, earning a score of 3 or 4.</p>

<p>Students will receive a letter grade for each course based on the
percentage of <i>required</i> skills they can perform on their own, using the
following scale:</p>

<table class="grades">
<tr>
  <th>Grade</th><th>percent of competencies<br>with score of 3 or greater</th>
<tr>
  <td>A</td><td>90</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>B</td><td>80</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>C</td><td>70</td>
<tr>
  <td>D</td><td>60</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>E</td><td>less than 60</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>Class Policies:</h2>

<h3>Attendance:</h3>
<p>
Attendance in this class is mandatory. We will be learning new things each time
class meets, as well as practicing our newly aquired skills.  Regular
attendance will be essential to success. 
</p>

<h3>Classroom Conduct:</h3>
<p>
Every student should practice behavior that supports learning. All students are
expected to show respect for their classmates, the teacher and other staff
members, and to be actively engaged in learning for this course during their
time in class.
<br><br>
Students should likewise respect our computer lab as a place of learning, and
treat all equipment with care and leave it ready for classmates using after
them.
<br><br>
Specficially:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Please do not eat or drink in the lab.  We have plenty of table space in
  the commons area where you can eat and drink.</li>

  <li>Please push in chairs and return keyboards, mice, and monitors to the
  positions you found them in.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Academic Honesty:</h3>
<p>
The Monrovia Consolidated School System is committed to the highest standards
of academic honesty. As a result, appropriate actions will be taken in this
course to discourage breaches of academic honesty. All work presented by the
student as theirs should be the work of that student alone.  Plagurism in any
form will not be allowed.
